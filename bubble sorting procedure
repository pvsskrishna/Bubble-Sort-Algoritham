Bubble sort algoritham is an algoritham which is used to sort the given list of values either in asscending order or in descending order.
if length of the collection is n then we need to perform n-1 passes.

ALGORITHAM:
step1: consider a list of n values

step2:compare the value present at 0th position with the value present at 1st position, if it is greater then swap both values else ignore.

step3:compare value present at 1st position with the value at 2nd position and repeate the same thing through the length of collection.

step4: after the completion of step3 we will get a list collection where highest value will be at the sorted position(that is at the end of the collection).

step5: repeate the step1 to step4  for n-1 times, so that we can get the sorted collection.

NOTE: we can do this bubble sorting only for list collection only, 
beacuse for set and dictionary indexing is not possible
string and tuple are immutable collection data types
